About Me:
======
<p class="main_text">
I am currently a 2nd-year Ph.D. candidate majoring in Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://case.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Case Western Reserve University(CWRU)</a>, working under the supervision of <a href="https://case.edu/engineering/about/faculty-and-staff-directory/zonghe-chua" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Zonghe Chua</a> in the <a href="https://enhanced-telerobotics.github.io/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enhanced Robotic Interfaces & Experiences(ERIE) Lab</a>. I received my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from CWRU, where I also worked under the supervision of Prof. Chua. I received my B.S. in Mechanical Design, Manufacturing, and Automation from <a href="https://english.hust.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HUST</a> in China.

Research Interests:
======
<p class="main_text">
My current research focus is to develop <strong>differentiable physical simulator</strong> for soft grippers. 
</p>
<p class="main_text">
My broader research interests include vision-based sensing, soft haptic actuators, soft robotic grippers, physical simulation, and machine learning.
