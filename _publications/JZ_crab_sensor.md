title: "A High Load Density Miniature Force Sensor for Probing With Robot Feet"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/JZ_crab_sensor
excerpt: 'Force sensing on the end effector is crucial for mobile, legged robots to adapt to varying terrain and manipulate objects in complex environments. Since efficient legs have to be light and load bearing, force sensors need to have increased load density while still providing accurate multi-axis forces. Here, we demonstrate a low-cost solution to this problem that integrates four sets of strain gauges, analog-to-digital conversion, and data processing into a single leg of a crab-scale robot.'
