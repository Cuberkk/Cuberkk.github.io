title: "Encounter Haptics for Nurse Training in Virtual Reality"
collection: selected_projects
permalink: /selected_projects/encounter_haptic
excerpt: 'Traditional nurse training relies heavily on hands-on practice with real patients, which is constrained by clinical availability and safety considerations. In this project, we develop a VR-based encounter haptics system using a Kinova 7-DOF robotic arm to provide realistic physical interaction and force feedback for immersive nurse training.'
