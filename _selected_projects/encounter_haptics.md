<p class="main_text">
Sensory substitution is an effective approach for displaying stable haptic feedback to a teleoperator under time delay. The finger is highly articulated, and can sense movement and force in many directions, making it a promising location for sensory substitution based on kinesthetic feedback. However, existing finger kinesthetic devices either provide only one-degree-of-freedom feedback, are bulky, or have low force output. Soft pneumatic actuators have high power density, making them suitable for realizing high force kinesthetic feedback in a compact form factor. We present a soft pneumatic handheld kinesthetic feedback device for the index finger that is controlled using a constant curvature kinematic model.
