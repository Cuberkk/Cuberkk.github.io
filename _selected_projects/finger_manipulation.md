title: "Synergy-Based Force Signal Compression for Human In-Hand Manipulation"
collection: selected_projects
permalink: /publication/in_hand_manipulation
excerpt: 'In-hand manipulation plays a critical role in high-performance teleoperation and immersive, embodied virtual interactions. In this project, we embed three ATI force/torque sensors into an in-hand-sized object to capture multi-finger manipulation forces and investigate preliminary synergy-based force signal compression strategies.‘
