excerpt: 'Lymphedema is a chronic and progressive condition caused by dysfunction of the lymphatic system, leading to excessive fluid accumulation in soft tissues. In this project, we develop a clinically deployable desktop indenter system, termed Clindent, to noninvasively obtain in vivo creep loading curves from patient limbs, enabling longitudinal assessment of tissue mechanical properties during recovery.'
